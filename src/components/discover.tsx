                        Records reveal an unsettling upward trend in greenhouse gas emissions over time. CO2 levels were meticulously documented in regions like Texas, Tutuila, the Republic of Korea, Indonesia, and Algeria, showing a persistent rise in carbon emissions due to industrialization, energy production, and transportation. Meanwhile, methane emissions were recorded in places such as Taipei, Guam, Israel, and Mexico, driven by agricultural practices, waste management, and fossil fuel extraction.
